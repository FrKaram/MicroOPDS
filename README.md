# MicroOPDS

The aim of this project is to obtain a small OPDS Server for calibre library
The current target is to have this running as a Windows Service and then, maybe, leverage .net core multiplatform capabilities to have it run everywhere.

I have a working alpha version (will share the source when possible)

Progress is slow as it is a free time project.
